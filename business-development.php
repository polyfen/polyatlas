            <li>Why does the business exists?</li>

        <h4>Identify the Target Public</h4>

        <p>0.5&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;2 hours</p>
        <small>Description</small>
        <p>By understanding the business and surveying the industry we can already intuitively narrow down some demographics of what an ideal customer should be like.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, especially if you're designing a Brand Identity for a foreign market, it's very important to understand the cultural context. You can start by surveying the country's cultural background and demographics on <a href="https://wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GeographyNow" target="_blank">Geography Now!</a>.</p>
        <p>However, it is possible for a Brand to have multiple Public Groups which serve different purposes. For instance, a creative agency might have a Public Group (A) which includes decision makers of other businesses needing creative services, and (B) people from the creative industry who would be interested in the content published by the Brand.</p>
        <p>At this point we must identify the different possible Public Groups, breakdown their corresponding demographic characteristics, and make <strong>User Personas</strong> stereotyping the ideal Public member of each group.</p>
        <p>Each User Persona can include traits like:</p>
        <div class="indent">
        <ol>
        <li>Profile Picture</li>
        <li>Name&thinsp;/&thinsp;Pseudonym</li>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Gender</li>
        <li>Residence location</li>
        <li>Occupation</li>
        <li>Income</li>
        <li>Socio-economic class</li>
        <li>Interests</li>
        <li>Brands they trust</li>
        <li>Unsatisfied need&thinsp;/&thinsp;Problem</li>
        <li>Solution offered by the business</li>
        <li>Desired business goal</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <p>This is a good time for your business to follow your Persona's interests in social media as a reference for the content they are consuming.</p>
        <small>The Poly Group</small>
        <p>Here is an example of a User Persona.</p>

        <p>By now, based on the Business Analysis, we know the Industry and Niche it belongs to.</p>
        <p>A quick Google search can help us identify the industry leaders worldwide, and by adding the location of the specific markets of the business to the Google search we can also find direct competitors operating in the same area.</p>
        <p>Different tools can also be used to better understand the industry and Target Public, like (1) Who's using and following related social media hashtags, (2) Who's following your other brands from your industry on social media, and (3) Analytics tools (like <a href="https://www.similarweb.com" target="_blank">SimilarWeb</a>, <a href="https://www.alexa.com/" target="_blank">Alexa</a>, and <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/" target="_blank">Quantcast</a>).</p>

        <p>Make a list of both the industry leaders and direct competitors considering (1) which traits are common in the industry's brands, (2) which traits can be used to differentiate the business' Brand over its competitors, and (3) which brand is closer to the business' aspirations.</p>
