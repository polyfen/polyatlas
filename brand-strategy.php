        <small>Description</small>
        <p>The best place to start choosing a direction for the Brand Identity would be to define what the Brand stands for at its core. What personality&thinsp;/&thinsp;mood&thinsp;/&thinsp;look-and-feel should identify the Brand Identity. What is the Brand going to be saying to its public.</p>
        <p>The personality of a Brand can initially be defined by its Voice (what the Brand says) and Tone (how the Brand says it).</p>
        <p>The Voice describes what type of content will be communicated by the Brand. The voice is what the Brand says, what type of information does the Brand offer to the public.</p>
        <p>The most basic features of the Brand’s Voice are typically communicating the business’ services&thinsp;/&thinsp;products and its prices.</p>
        <p>However, a Brand can also choose to publish educational content, or share curated links to relevant information on social media; Or perhaps the Brand’s Voice can focus on communicating the business’ mission and core values, or on promoting a humanitarian cause.</p>

        <p>In the digital age, more and more Brands are taking a stand to voice their opinions on <strong>socio-political matters.</strong> This is a risky and polarising move for Brands since they can gain the respect and loyalty of some Public Groups who share their socio-political views; However, on the other hand, they can also suddenly loose the support of long-time followers.</p>
        <p>American Football player Colin Kaepernick was the first of many athletes to kneel during the national anthem played before each NFL game as a form of passive protest against police brutality and racial oppression. After <a href="https://www.nike.com/" target="_blank">Nike</a> endorsed Kaepernick in a series of adverts, backlash ensued with a viral wave of conservative groups going so far as to burn their costly Nike shoes as a way to boycott the company.</p>

        <p>While the Voice defines what a Brand says, the Tone determines how the Brand says it. Together, the Voice and the Tone make up the foundations of a Brand’s personality.</p>
        <p>If the Brand should appeal to a younger, laid-back target public, for instance, a suitable tone would be casual and straight-forward; Whereas, if the Brand targets an older, more traditional target public, it would perhaps be more suitable to maintain a slightly more formal, conservative tone.</p>

Its primary purpose is to be used internally as a mantra to guide the creative process when sketching a Logo, copywriting a slogan, designing an ad, or when developing any other type of Brand Communication.

        <small>Description</small>
        <p>A Moodboard is a collection of visual references including photography, illustration, architecture, design, and art. It serves as a source of inspiration during the creative process by identifying common colours and shapes associated with the desired mood of the Brand.</p>
        <p>Some images might represent the lifestyle of a typical member of the target public; Others might represent the Brand’s Keywords or other qualities. Other images could include logos or graphics from other brands that can serve as inspiration. The representations can be quite subtle and abstract, or they can be descriptive and concrete.</p>
        <p>Collect approximately 40 images which represent the chosen Creative Concept.</p>
        <p>You can browse images on <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>, <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribbble</a>, <a href="https://www.behance.net/" target="

        <small>Description</small>
        <p>At this time, the images collected for the Moodboard should be tessellated into a single canvas.</p>
        <p>It’s advisable to collect the images in an A3 paper format, which is large enough to appreciate each image individually, yet the whole is other than the mere sum of its parts. Furthermore, an A3 format can be printed and hanged on a wall, to look at from a close or farther distance. And it can also be seen in a screen as a whole, and zoomed into the different sections of it.</p>
        <p>It is also advisable to feature the most relevant images more prominently, in a larger size, and adding the secondary images at a smaller scale.</p>
        <p>Lastly, in order to make an homogeneous mix of images, avoid placing similar images close to each-other.</p>
        <p>There are also tools like <a href="https://invisionapp.com" target="_blank">InVision</a> boards which make this process easier.</p>

        <h2 id="naming">1.6. Naming</h2>
        <small>Task</small>
        <h4>Brainstorm potential brand names</h4>
        <small>Role</small>
        <p>Marketing Analyst</p>
        <small>Estimated workload</small>
        <p>4&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;12 hours</p>
        <small>Description</small>
        <p>Considering that many linguists advocate for the theory that language is the basis of —or at least it deeply influences— complex thought; The Brand Name is one of the most —if not, the most— important elements to identify a Brand.</p>
        <p>The Visual Identity of a Brand can be updated overtime, and there tends to be a certain backlash from the target public until they familiarise themselves enough with the new Visual Identity.</p>
        <p>However, if you change the name of widely recognised Brand overnight, the target public will most likely be baffled by the change, as if the Brand would have to gain the target public’s trust all over again, as if they have just met a new person for the first time.</p>
        <p>Therefore, it is important to invest the sufficient time to get the Brand Name right before gaining Brand awareness of a large public.</p>
        <p>There are multiple parameters that weigh into the quality of a Brand Name. Namely:</p>
        <h5>1.  Easy to pronounce correctly</h5>
        <div class="indent">
        <p>Every member of the Target Public should be able to read the name for the first time, without having heard it before, and pronounce it correctly and with ease. This is a especially difficult task for Brands that might target public from different countries. And in today’s globalised world, it pays off to have a Brand Name consistently recognisable in the same way by public members who speak different languages.</p>
        <p>Generally, if a Brand Name is pronounced in the same way in english and spanish, then it’s most likely pronounced somewhat similarly throughout the globe.</p>
        <p>In order to ensure a universal pronunciation, avoid diphthong phonemes. Those are sounds formed by a combination of two vowels within a single syllable. For instance, the english word “eat” would be pronounced as /i:t/ in english, and it would be pronounced as /e:a:t/ in spanish and many other languages. In general, avoid the use of multiple vowels in any single syllable.</p>
        <p>Diphthong phonemes can even be present in single-vowel single-syllable words. For instance, the word “oh” would be pronounced as /oʊ/ by native english speakers, while it would be pronounced as /o/ by native spanish, italian, portuguese, french speakers and many others.</p>
        <p>For instance, a common misconception is that, the brand name “Nike”, which was originally meant to be pronounced as /ˈnaɪki/, it is more often pronounced as /ˈnaɪk/ in non-native english speaking countries.</p>
        <p>When branding for Asian markets, it's also important to consider that most Asian languages don't differentiate "l" and "r" letters from each other. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yzMUs3badc" target="_blank">"Why some Asian accents swap Ls and Rs in English
        "</a></p>
        </div>
        <h5>2.  Easy to spell correctly</h5>
        <div class="indent">
        <p>Every member of the target public should be able to spell the name correctly upon hearing the name for the first time, and without having read it before.</p>
        <p>Avoid using numbers, hyphens, apostrophes, and other punctuation signs, and TLD (for instance, ".com") as a part of your Brand Name.</p>
        <p>If possible, avoid unorthodox capitalisation or spacing. For instance, if you hear for the first time a brand name composed of two different, distinctive words, you would be most likely compelled to guess that the Brand Name is spelled with space in the middle.</p>
        <p>Think about the first time that you have heard the name “Facebook”, you could have guessed to spell the brand name following the corresponding grammatical rules as “Face Book”. The same applies to “MySpace”, which could be spelled as “My Space”; “Coca-Cola”, which could be spelled “Coca Cola”; “PayPal”, is often misspelled as “Paypal”; or “NikePlus”, which could be misspelled as “Nike Plus”, “Nike+”, or “Nike +”. Furthermore, upon hearing the Brand Name “FedEx” for the first time, you might guess that it’s meant to be spelled as “Fedex”, “Fed Ex”, or even “Fed X” perhaps. Another case to consider is that just as upon hearing “3M” for the first time you might guess to spell the Brand Name as “three M” or “three m” or even “three em”, or “Six Flags” could be mistakenly spelled as “6 Flags”.</p>
        <p>Likewise, avoid double letters, such as “Hennessy” could be spelled as “Henesy” by some public members.</p>
        <p>In order to ensure a clear and consistent understanding of your Brand Name, you must avoid uncommon capitalisation and spacing.</p>
        <p>Composite Brand Names, made out of two or more words, should be set with a grammatically correct capitalisation and spacing in order to avoid confusion from the public in regards to the correct spelling of the Brand Name.</p>
        <p>Another matter to consider is the avoidance of ambiguous phonemes. For instance, upon hearing the phoneme /i/, an public member would guess that the syllable is spelled with either “i”, “y”, “e”, “ee”, “ea”, or “ie”. Just as the phoneme /ʊ/ could be spelled in english with an “u”, “oo”, or “w”. Furthermore, the letter “j” might be pronounced as /dʒ/ (as in “jump”) in some languages, as /h/ (as in “hot”) in others, and as /j/ (as in “yellow”) in other languages. Likewise, the letter “c” could be pronounced as /k/ in some cases, and as /s/ in others, and additionally as /ts/ in slavic languages.</p>
        <p>The vowel “a”, and secondarily the vowels “o”, “u”, and “e” (in single-vowel syllables), seem to be the most accessible in regards to their universal pronounceability across different languages. And the consonants “b”, “d”, “f”,  “k”, “l”, “m”, “n”, “p”, “r”, “s”, and “t” seem to be the more commonly pronounced across the most languages.</p>
        <p>Leaving the letters “c”, “g”, “h”, “i”, “j”, “q”, “v”, “w”, “x”, “y”, and “z” as preferably avoidable.</p>
        <p>It is of utmost importance that your target public knows what your brand name is, and how it’s meant to be spelled.</p>
        <p>Consider that of course if a business is set on targeting exclusively a public of an specific language, then the universal pronounceability and spellabillity are not as important. However, it is always good to future-proof the Brand Name and give the business the option to expand to new markets without having to sacrifice the quality of their Brand Name.</p>
        </div>
        <h5>3. Relatively short</h5>
        <div class="indent">
        <p>A short name will be usually easier to pronounce and remember. The shorter, the better.</p>
        <p>However, considering that nowadays most short Brand Names are already taken. An alternative is to come up with a compound Brand Name, made up of two or more words, or initialisms. For instance, SalesForce, Mastercard, Jack Daniels, Johnnie Walker, Land Rover, Harley-Davidson, H&M, BMW, UPS, IBM, HSBC.</p>
        </div>
        <h5>4. Coherent</h5>
        <div class="indent">
        <p>The name should fit the overall direction of the company, represent the Creative Concept, belong to the industry, and have an accepted connotation.</p>
        <p>For instance, most brands would avoid using adjectives or nouns with a generally negative connotation such as “evil”, “hell”, or “satan”. Although, for a heavy-metal music band, those would make for a coherent Brand Name in regards to their industry and niche.</p>
        <p>However, for most brand outside of those particular niches, it would be more suitable to avoid any words that could have a negative connotation altogether.</p>
        </div>
        <h5>5. Adaptable</h5>
        <div class="indent">
        <p>A modular name that is easy to abbreviate can be a tremendous advantage. When a Brand Name is mentioned over and over again, the target public will seek to replace it with an abbreviation. This is especially common amongst the employees of a company who need to mention the company's name on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>For instance, Facebook is abbreviated as simply “fb” on a casual setting, just as Instagram is abbreviated as “Insta”.</p>
        <p>Additionally, if the brand might branch out into different sub-brands, a modular, adaptable name can connect the sub-brands to the master-brand.</p>
        <p>For instance, at The Polyfen Group, we internally refer to our company simply as "Poly"; and we've carried on the DNA of our master-brand to the names of our family of sub-brands "Polyfen", "Poly Atlas", and "Poly Forum".</p>
        </div>
        <h5>6. Consistent</h5>
        <div class="indent">
        <p>Even though you might abbreviate a brand's name internally, amongst the company's employees. It is important to maintain a consistent use of the name on all public Brand Communications. Otherwise, people might be confused in regards to how the band name is actually meant to be spelled.</p>
        <p>Ensure that the brand name is always capitalised, spaced, and punctuated in the same way throughout all the brand communications, including the logo.</p>
        <p>Unorthodox capitalisation, spacing, and punctuation can be an issue both for how easy it is to spell a brand name correctly upon hearing for the first time, and it additionally poses a problem for consistency.</p>
        <img loading="lazy" src="imgs/lowercase-logos.webp">
        <p>For instance, the use of the brand name on behalf of Facebook is inconsistent and can confuse the public as to how it is actually meant to be spelled, since in most brand communications the Brand Name is spelled as “Amazon”, while their logo, the centrepiece of their Brand, is set in all lower-case letters, as “amazon”. The same can be said of “Facebook”, whose logo spells “facebook”, “eBay” and its “ebay” logo, or “Adidas”, whose logo spells “adidas”. Other examples of all lower-case logos include “Intel”, “Accenture”, “Pepsi”, “Mastercard”, and many others.</p>
        <img loading="lazy" src="imgs/uppercase-logos.webp">
        <p>On the other hand, the same issue occurs when a logo is set in all upper-case letters. Such as “American Express”, whose logo spells “AMERICAN EXPRESS”, “Oracle”, whose logo spells “ORACLE”, “Samsung” and its “SAMSUNG” logo, or “Hermès” logo spelling “HERMÈS”. This is a very common tendency, which, besides of creating inconsistency in the use of the brand name, it also reduces the readability of the logo, especially in longer words set in all-uppercase, and especially if the word contains diacritic signs, like the “grave e accent” in “Hermès”. Other examples of all upper-case logos include “Siemens”, “Toyota”, “Honda”, “Kia”, “Chanel”, “Louis Vuitton”, and many others.</p>
        <p>The particular practice of setting a brand name in all upper-case letters is not entirely unacceptable. However, the designer must be aware that readability and consistency are being sacrificed for the sake of aesthetics.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Brand Names including initialisms —such as “DHL”, “UPS”, “HSBC”, “BMW”, or “H&M”— , must be set in uppercase accordingly.</p>
        <img loading="lazy" src="imgs/smallcaps-logos.webp">
        <p>A suitable compromise that works around this issue  is the use of small caps, which clearly distinguishes the correct capitalisation of the words, while featuring an uppercase alphabet. An example of this can be seen on the logos of “Jack Daniel’s”, “Johnnie Walker”, “John Deere”, and “Tiffany & Co.”.</p>
        <p>As you can see, even some of the largest, most renowned Brands are guilty of using their Brand Name inconsistently. Admittedly, since the public is quite familiar with the brand names of these large brands, they are less likely to be confounded by the inconsistency use of their Brand Names. However, this issue especially poses a threat for new and emerging business who want to get their name out there. If the target public is not sure about what the actual name of your brand name is, then your brand is not communicating it clearly enough to the public. The Brand Name should be spelled in the Brand’s logo just as it’s meant to be spelled in any other form of communication.</p>
        </div>
        <h5>7. Unique</h5>
        <div class="indent">
        <p>All of the previous criteria (easy to spell, easy to pronounce, coherent, adaptable, and consistent) relies on the Brand Name actually not being already taken by a different business.</p>
        <p>Checking if another company has registered the desired Brand Name as a trademark in the same industry and in the same country that the business will be operating can be a hassle; And registering a trademark, although useful for a legal dispute, doesn't necessarily grant exclusive ownership worldwide for perpetuity.</p>
        <p>However, it is important to secure the Brand Name in as many mediums as possible to ensure that the target public will associate the desired brand name exclusively to the specific business being branded.</p>
        <p>Leaving the trademarks right aside, the first step in claiming a brand name is buying a web domain and establishing an online presence in social media.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, when people want to access a website of a brand they've just heard of, they will most likely type the Brand's name into Google. However, given that most websites use ".com" domains, a small minority of users might try typing "[yourbrandname].com" as a web address.</p>
        <p>In any case, having a ".com" web domain might give a more reliable impression, since most people are used to ".com" domains. Although, in present times, it is incredibly hard to find good ".com" web domains available for purchase.</p>
        <p>A possible solution would be registering a different TLD like ".co", ".io", ".org", or ".net". Another alternative, would be adding a prefix or suffix to your Brand Name, something like "weare[yourbrandname].com", or "[yourbrandname]team.com".</p>
        <p>*Refer to Naming Architecture for further insight on this topic.</p>
        <p>Naming is exhaustive and iterative process. All authorities in the Branding industry seem to agree on one thing in regards to naming: <strong>It is impossible to find the perfect name; be ready to compromise.</strong> However, it is important to consider all of this parameters when selecting a brand name so you have a clear idea of the pros and cons of each potential name before reaching a final decision.</p>
        <p>It takes time to get used to a new name for a company. Although the owner/s of the company being branded might not love the top name choice at first, they will surely grow to love it as the name grows to be associated with the brand over time.</p>
        </div>
        <h5>8. Compromise</h5>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>The perfect Brand Name doesn't exist, it's a fallacy. Be ready to compromise and go for the most suitable direction you've surveyed, even if it's not perfect. The Brand Name will grow on the business owners and target public over time.</p>

        <p>However, considering lack of availability of brand names nowadays, it is advisable to list the diagram the different names that can identify the business in different use cases.</p>
        <p>A Naming Architecture, would typically include the following variations:</p>
        <h5>1. Primary Brand Name:</h5>
        <div class="indent">
        <p>The preferred Brand Name as should be communicated in all Brand Touchpoints. For instance, “Polyfen”. And it should be preferably spelled in the same way in the Brand’s logo, and all other Brand Communications.</p>

        <div class="indent">
        <p>A fallback alternative for Touchpoints where the Brand Name is not available. For instance, “PolyfenTeam”. The fallback Brand Name should as well be preferably secured as a “.com” domain as well.

        <img loading="lazy" src="imgs/microsoft-windows.webp">
        <p>A business can use a single brand to identify all their Brand Communications. However, in some cases, it’s suitable to develop different Brand Identities for the products, services, divisions, or subsidiaries of a business. For instance, the business registered as “Microsoft Corporation” is identified with the “Microsoft” brand, which has a sub-brands for many products, most notably “Windows”, the operative system.</p>
        <p>Before considering if a particular business needs to be identified with multiple Brands, one must understand that the marketing efforts of a business would have to be distributed amongst the different Brands. Hence, small businesses would likely struggle to spend the time and resources necessary to maintain multiple Brands and promote each separate Brand through different social media accounts.</p>
        <p>Creating a separate brand for a product, service, division, or subsidiary of a business should be kept to a minimum and it should be only done when the Sub-Brand would communicate a distinctively different product, service, division, or subsidiary of the business.</p>

        <h5>Monolithic brand Architecture</h5>
        <img loading="lazy" src="imgs/fedex.webp">
        <blockquote>Characterised by a strong, single Master-Brand. Customers make choices based on Brand loyalty. Features and benefits matter less to the consumer than the Brand promise and persona. Brand extensions use the parent’s identity, and generic descriptors. — Alina Wheeler, “Designing Brand Identity”</blockquote>
        <p>The FedEx Corporation counts with a Sub-Brand for each of its business  divisions. All easily identified as part of the FedEx family.</p>
        <hr class="third-separator">
        <h5>Endorsed Brand Architecture</h5>
        <img loading="lazy" src="imgs/nike-jordan.webp">
        <blockquote>Characterised by marketing synergy between the product or division, and the parent. The product or division has a clearly defined market presence, and benefits from the association, endorsement, and visibility of the parent. — Alina Wheeler, “Designing Brand Identity”</blockquote>
        <p>Nike counts with a line of products inspired by the famous basketball player Michael Jordan; the iconic shoes and apparel belonging to the “Jordan” collection can be identified with its own logo as belonging to a separate Brand from Nike. However, on most Jordan products, the Nike logo is also prominently displayed.</p>
        <hr class="third-separator">
        <h5>Pluralistic Brand Architecture</h5>
        <img loading="lazy" src="imgs/unilever.webp">
        <blockquote>Characterised by a series of well-known consumer Brands. The name of the parent may be either invisible or inconsequential to the consumer, and known only to the investment community. Many parent companies develop a system for corporate endorsement that is tertiary. — Alina Wheeler, “Designing Brand Identity”</blockquote>
        <p>Even though Unilever’s Sub-Brands are publicly endorsed by their parent company, each Sub-Brand is marketed strongly so the consumers will identify them independently of Unilever.</p>
        <hr class="third-separator">
        <h5>Colab brand architecture</h5>
        <img loading="lazy" src="imgs/game-of-thrones-lagavulin.webp">
        <p>On special occasions, Brands which are not necessarily owned by a single corporation decide to team up to develop a unique product or service; More commonly, a limited-edition product or a novelty collector’s item.</p>
        <img loading="lazy" src="imgs/game-of-thrones.webp">
        <p>On the eve of HBO airing the last season of Game of Thrones, the TV series production company teamed up with multiple whisky producers to distill a series of single malt scotches each one inspired in a different house or faction from the series.</p>
        <hr class="third-separator">
        <h5>Composite Brand Architecture</h5>
        <img loading="lazy" src="imgs/alphabet.webp">
        <p>Brand Architecture is not always black or white. It is common for business to adopt a more flexible approach combining multiple types of architecture. Most often in larger corporations one would find that the Master-Brand has sub-brands which, in turn, are parents to further Sub-Brands. Within the whole family/portfolio of brands belonging to a business, some of the Brands might be better identified as Monolithic, while others as Endorsed, or Pluralistic.</p>
        <p>"Alphabet, Inc" is the business facing Master-Brand of multiple pluralistic Sub-Brands, which include Youtube, Google, Android, Waymo, Nest, Waze, Calico, and a few others. Of these, the most notable is Google, which is parent to a wide range of Monolithic products, including Gmail, Google Maps, Google Translate, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Chrome, Google Ads, and many more.</p>
        <img loading="lazy" src="imgs/apple-nike.webp">
        <p>The Apple Watch - NikePlus edition is an example of two big Brands partnering up to develop a unique product. Note that in this case, the colab Brand Architecture type happens to connect two Monolithic Brand-Architecture Sub-Brands.</p>
        <img loading="lazy" src="imgs/nike-full.webp">
        <p>Furthermore, if we take a closer look into Nike’s full Brand Architecture, we can see that it counts with (1) a Monolithic Sub-Brand (NikePlus), (2) an Endorsed Sub-Brand (Jordan), (3) Pluralistic Sub-Brands (Hurley and Converse), and lastly, (4) a Colab Second-Sub-Brand (Apple Watch, NikePlus edition).</p>
        <p>On a tangent, consider that the business structure and the Brand Architecture of an enterprise is not necessary diagrammed in the same way.</p>
        <p>The business should be structured as it’s more suitable for the internal business operations, whereas the Brand Identity Architecture should be diagrammed as it’s more suitable for the public.</p>
        <img loading="lazy" src="imgs/business-structure-and-brand-architecture.webp">
        <p>The business operating as the FedEx Corporation is responsible for managing seven subsidiary divisions. While the business structure positions the corporate division on top, for the tar get public, the Brand Identity places the Sub-Brand on the same level as the subsidiaries, all under the umbrella of the FedEx Master-Brand.</p>
